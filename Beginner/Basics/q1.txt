Q1)  What is JavaScript?


Ans)
       (Javascript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive.
        It runs in the browser and also on the server using Node.js.
        It helps in handling dynamic content, DOM manipulation, events, APIs, and building modern web applications.)

        (
            JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted programming language mainly used for web development.
            It allows us to create interactive and dynamic web pages by manipulating the DOM, handling events, and making API calls.
            With technologies like Node.js, it can also be used for backend development.
            I have used JavaScript in building React-based frontend applications.

        (
            JavaScript is a versatile, high-level, prototype-based scripting language primarily used for web development.
            It enables dynamic behavior on websites through DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming, and API integration.
            With ES6+ features like arrow functions, promises, async/await, and modules, modern JavaScript supports building scalable applications.
            I have applied JavaScript concepts while working on React projects for managing state, handling APIs, and building reusable components.
