Q12) What are reserved keywords?

Ans) 
    Reserved keywords are special words in JavaScript that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as variable, function, or class names.
    They are reserved by the language to perform specific operations.


    🔹 Examples of Reserved Keywords
            Some common JavaScript reserved keywords are:

                var
                let
                const
                if
                else
                for
                while
                function
                return
                class
                new
                this
                try
                catch

    ❌ Invalid Example
             let for = 10; // ❌ Error: 'for' is a reserved keyword
    ✅ Valid Example
            let count = 10; // ✅ valid variable name


    📌 Why are reserved keywords important?

            They define the syntax of JavaScript
            Prevent ambiguity in the language
            Ensure proper code execution
