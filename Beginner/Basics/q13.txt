Q13) What is strict mode?

Ans)
    Strict mode is a special mode in JavaScript that helps write cleaner and safer code by enforcing stricter rules.
    It helps catch common coding mistakes and prevents the use of unsafe features.


    🔹 How do you enable strict mode?

            By adding "use strict" at the beginning of a script or function.

                "use strict";
                x = 10; // ❌ Error: x is not declared

    🔹 Example without strict mode
                x = 10; // works (but bad practice)


📌 Key Features of Strict Mode

        Variables must be declared before use
        Prevents use of duplicate parameter names
        Disallows use of reserved keywords
        this is undefined in functions (not window)
        Makes debugging easier





        ✅ Strict Mode vs Non-Strict Mode

                Feature	                    Strict Mode	                                    Non-Strict Mode
                
                Variable declaration	    Must declare variables (let, var, const)	    Variables can be used without declaration
                Silent errors	            Converted into real errors	                    Errors may fail silently
                Duplicate parameters	    ❌ Not allowed	                              ✅ Allowed
                Reserved keywords	        ❌ Cannot be used	                          Sometimes allowed
                this keyword	            undefined in functions	                        Refers to window object
                Debugging	                Easier	                                        Harder
