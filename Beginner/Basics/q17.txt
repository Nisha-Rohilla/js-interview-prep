Q17) What is an expression in JavaScript?

Ans) 
    An expression in JavaScript is any piece of code that produces a value.
    It can be a value, a variable, or a combination of values and operators.

    🔹 Examples of Expressions
            5 + 3          // arithmetic expression → 8
            "Hello"       // string expression
            x > 10        // boolean expression
            age * 2       // expression using variable

    🔹 Expression vs Statement (Quick Difference)
            Expression	                        Statement
            Produces a value	                Performs an action
            Can be part of a statement	        Usually stands alone
            Example: 5 + 2	                    Example: let x = 5;

    Example:

    let x = 5 + 2; // 5 + 2 is an expression
   
    An expression is a piece of JavaScript code that evaluates to a value.
