Q3) Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language?

Ans)  
    In short
            JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, but modern JavaScript engines use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to improve performance.

    In detailed
            Traditionally, JavaScript is considered an interpreted language because the code runs directly in the browser without manual compilation.
            However, modern JavaScript engines like Google’s V8 use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, where the code is compiled into machine code at runtime to improve performance.
            So technically, JavaScript uses a combination of interpretation and JIT compilation.

            EXAMPLE
                    -The browser's JavaScript engine first reads the JavaScript code.
                    -Then it parses the code and converts it into an internal representation.
                    -After that, the JIT compiler compiles the code into machine code at runtime.
                    -This improves performance and makes execution faster.
