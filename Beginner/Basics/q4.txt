        ✅ Features of JavaScript (Interview Answer)

                High-level language
                    JavaScript is easy to read and write, as it handles memory management automatically.

                Interpreted & JIT compiled
                    JavaScript runs in the browser using an interpreter with Just-In-Time compilation for better performance.

                Dynamically typed
                    Variable types are decided at runtime, so we don’t need to define data types explicitly.

                Prototype-based Object-Oriented
                    JavaScript uses prototypes instead of classical classes for object inheritance.

                Event-driven
                    It responds to user actions like clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.

                Asynchronous programming support
                    JavaScript supports callbacks, promises, and async/await for non-blocking operations.

                Platform independent
                    JavaScript runs on any browser and operating system.

                Client-side & Server-side support
                    It works on the client side (browser) and server side using Node.js.

                Lightweight & fast
                    JavaScript is lightweight and executes quickly in modern browsers.

                Rich ecosystem & libraries
                    It has a large ecosystem of frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.
