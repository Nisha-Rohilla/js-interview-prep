Q5) What is ECMAScript?


Ans)  ECMAScript is the standardized specification maintained by ECMA International that defines the core features of JavaScript.
      JavaScript follows this specification, which ensures consistency across different JavaScript engines.
      New ECMAScript versions like ES6 introduced features such as let, const, arrow functions, classes, and modules.
      This standard defines the syntax, data types, objects, and core features of JavaScript so that all browsers follow the same rules
