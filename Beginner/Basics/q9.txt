Q9) What are variables?

Ans)    
    Variables are used to store data values that can be used and changed later in a program.
    In JavaScript, variables act as containers for storing information such as numbers, strings, or objects.


    JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables:

            var – old way (function-scoped)
            let – block-scoped, recommended 
            const – block-scoped, value cannot be reassigned
