Q1) What are primitive data types?

Ans) 
    Primitive data types are the basic, built-in data types that store single, simple values.
    They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed directly.


    🔹 List of Primitive Data Types in JavaScript

            JavaScript has 7 primitive data types:

               1) Number – represents numbers
                     let age = 22;

               2) String – represents text
                     let name = "Nisha";

               3) Boolean – represents true or false
                     let isStudent = true;

               4) Undefined – variable declared but not assigned a value
                     let x;

               5) Null – represents an intentional empty value
                     let value = null;

               6) Symbol – represents a unique value (ES6)
                     let id = Symbol("id");

               7) BigInt – represents very large integers
                     let big = 12345678901234567890n;
