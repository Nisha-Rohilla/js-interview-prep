Q) What is the assignment operator?

And)
    The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
    JavaScript also provides compound assignment operators to perform an operation and assignment in a single step.

        💻 Code Examples
                🔹 Basic Assignment Operator (=)
                        let x = 10;
                        console.log(x); // 10

                🔹 Compound Assignment Operators
                        let a = 5;

                        a += 3; // a = a + 3
                        console.log(a); // 8

                        a -= 2; // a = a - 2
                        console.log(a); // 6

                        a *= 2; // a = a * 2
                        console.log(a); // 12

                        a /= 3; // a = a / 3
                        console.log(a); // 4

                        a %= 3; // a = a % 3
                        console.log(a); // 1

        🔍 Explanation 

        = assigns a value

        +=, -=, *=, /=, %= combine operation + assignment

        Improves code readability and reduces repetition
